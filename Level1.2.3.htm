Being a higher-level cybernetic agent can be defined as being an agent that
deals with multiple control circuits at the same time. 
Instantiations of higher-level agency are states, enterprises, and biological 
organisms, in contrast to parts of organisms that serve a single purpose, 
or mechanisms that control a single variable, like thermostats or Watt's
steam pressure regulator.
There are two senses
in which the definition can be satisfied. In a horizontal sense, it means that 
the agent is of a certain complexity in virtue of being occupied with several control
circuits. Different control circuits imply different target variables, which implies 
different goals. These goals can be independent states as such. But, strictly speaking, the goals with respect
to an individual agent are never independent from each other since their attainment always implies
for the agent the conflict of how to allocate the limited resources to them.
But when understood in a vertical sense, there is a further dependence which is
strictly one-directional, in the sense that there are lower-level control circuits whose
functioning enables the agent to address problems from which the agent would otherwise
be kept away.

A higher-level agent in the vertical sense is an agent that is ideally able to tackle 
tasks at different levels of detail by drilling down (see <a href="Level1.3.htm">Level 1.3</a>); other vertically
higher-level agents are at least able to cause the completion of 
higher-level tasks by invoking services without being able to drill down into a finer-grained
solution, should that be required.
Higher-level agents, in general, are therefore agents that bring about solutions to superior kinds 
of problems, while they do not have to deal with the kind of problems that
the lower-level agents are occupied with.
Their focus lies not on optimizing the individual circuits, but on improving the configuration
that exists between the different goals they pursue, and on reconciling the possibly conflicting
strategies employed by the agent for the purpose of reaching those goals.
While reconciliation in terms of a fair attribution of resources is the basic-level form
of addressing the problem of improving one's goal-configuration, there are more proactive
questions to be tackled in this context. What the agent should always seek is a configuration
where the reaching of one goal provides a superior solution to a problem rather than
just regulating a desired state of a system. These superior solutions are often
identifiable by their feature of unlocking new kinds of problems that wouldn't even
be addressable by the agent residing at the previous, inferior state.

There is the well-known distinction between "buy or make?", which
spells the difference between being able to tackle certain problems
at more fine-grained levels of detail, in case that necessity arises.
In other words, the difference consists in: do I just invoke a service by spending 
money, or will I do the work (creating a desired function) 
myself? But between invoking a service and thereby spending money,
and performing
work there is not really a crisp line (the invocation of the service often includes works like searching for
a supplier of the service, or the communicative efforts of specifying the service, checking
whether the service has been provided in a satisfactory way, etc.); on the other
hand when we ourselves perform a piece of work we often rely on lower-level services at some point, like bodily processes
which are strictly speaking not "within our direct control";
also costs are always involved not only when invoking services, but also when performing work
(via the expenditure of energy and time and therefore via not realising opportunity gains 
by spending these resources otherwise).

The horizontal aspects of the complexity introduced by higher level agency put the agent under 
pressure to address the need for setting up a goal system and reconciling the conflicts arising 
from the multiplicity of goals. The vertical aspects necessitate making decisions about which control 
circuits need to be put in place in order to allow the agent to continue to operate on high level. 
The higher level agent wants to keep a goal system that aligns the different goals in an optimal way 
and that avoids frictions among them. It also wants to harness lower level control units that are 
sufficiently reliable, have a good efficiency ratio, are easily replaceable, etc. Considering both 
aspects together, the main problem - next to getting clear about what its mail goal is in the first 
place â€“ is the problem of what the optimal architecture of problem-solution looks like.
