<h3 align='center'>Top-Down Thinking</h3>
<br>
<p class=PGStandard style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB>
The drill-down operation, whose specification this level is about, structures the overall content of the description of cybernetic philosophy. As
indicated by the terms "top-down thinking" and "drill-down operation", the idea represents the opposite of a bottom-up approach, which lays a foundation of
basic ideas and tries to build higher-level ideas on top of that. Also, the approach of top-down thinking embeds every idea explored in a wider-context (the 
super-levels of the considered level), and therefore distinguishes itself from a free-floating development of ideas which dispenses with attempts of
situating an idea within a context. That being said, there are situations where both contrastive approaches (bottom-up thinking and free-floating ideas) can
be effective, they are just not the starting point of the version of cybernetic philosophy considered in this collection of articles. Cybernetics is not
the study of what the world is, it is the study of how teleological systems interact with the world. There is thus enough room for contents and methods 
that are, however, ruled out for this exposition because they fall out of its scope.

The contents of a sub-level are not inferred or derived from its super-level, but there is a certain similarity to the method of logically deducing
a concluded proposition from its premise. This similarity consists in that the idea of a premise is something that can be accepted so that on its basis
the conclusion can also be accepted, given the deduction is correct. At the root of the relationships of propositions in chains of deduction lie the
axioms, which are not derived from other propositions but have to be self-sufficient and acceptable. The role of the propositions of Level 1 
corresponds in weak sense to that of axioms,
although it cannot be said that they are exactly such things, since they are imbued with empirical ideas rather than informed by purely logical principles, and
because they are supposed to provide a top-level perspective rather than a basic foundation of deduction. It might be objected that, since the
method of navigating from level to sub-level is top-down, the said bottom-up relationship that has been ruled out obtains when we move from a 
sub-level upwards to its super-level. 
Indeed in many cases what is said on the more detailed, more informative level of detail leads logically to what is said on the super-level, which 
summarizes the former and abstracts from its details, and therefore doesn't add any new information. While this bottom-up relationship does obtain, sometimes
merely in a weak, sometimes in a stricter logical sense,
the relationship does not extend to the <i>methodology of constructing</i> this map of ideas itself. It is Level 1 that has been considered first, 
and from here the zooming in has been and it supposed to be done. It would thus be misleading to speak of a bottom-up structure since that would suggest
that the contents of a level are the logical result of the contents of its subordinate levels. Also, a bottom-up philosophy presupposes that there is 
a solid ground at the lowest level of thinking, which this cybernetic approach does not presuppose.

A level and its sub-level are thus connected by a process of drilling down. Alternatively, one can say that two models of different levels of detail are
thus related. If we zoom in to a sub-level, this means that we already know something about a subject matter and are now interested in exploring it 
in more detail. It also means that typically we are already able to control a system to some degree, but now intend to control it in more detailed aspects,
to a higher degree of efficacy or efficiency, or that we want to reassure ourselves that we can account for the mechanisms underlying the already obtained control of
the system,and that we can develop alternative means of control if the primary control mechanism fails. The ability to perform a drill-down
in any specific domain is an intellectual capacity that is a specific aspect of the requisite variety (see p. 202 in <a
href="#AshbyIntroductionToCybernetics">[1]</a>) of a control unit.

Many examples of the drill-down procedure can be given. The very expression is in use e.g. in data warehouses, where a drill-down is a deaggregation of data.
If sums of revenues are given according to geographical regions in the warehouse, then a data drill-down into one of the regions will supply the
sums of the corresponding sub-regions and possibly further down to the level of turnovers of individual stores. 
In epidemiology, the zooming in to a higher level of detail
can entail that we look closer to understand the exact mechanisms of a disease pathway, given we alrady know beforehand about some causal link between
an exposure and the contraction of a disease. 
Literally "zooming" into the details of geographical map provides additional information. Reading the full version of a story or the account of a 
historical event as opposed to just
consuming its summary will do the same. E.g., learning that Caesar conquered Gaul vs. reading his De bello gallico. Another example is this map of cybernetics itself.
Since I do not only describe drill-down in this article ("Level 1.3") as a technique that can be used in various domains, e.g. databases and epidemiology, but
also use the drill-down when starting any new detailed article of this collection after indicating its content on its super-level, it follows that this map of cybernetic ideas is also another
collection of instances of drilling down. This reflects the fact that the writing of the map is in itself a cybernetic project. Exemplifications are
also counted as examples of drilling down, in the sense that thereby we look closer at certain claims by studying it in one of its example domains. 
Hence, examining the propositions made about higher level agency on Level 1.2.3 can be studied closer in the three example domains of 1.2.3.1 (the person),
1.2.3.2 (the enterprise), and 1.2.3.3 (macroeconomy). Also 1.2.1 (the philosophical problem of existence) is seen as an example of cybernetics derived
from applying the question of teleology to the problem of finding meaning in existence. If the examples of drilling-down that have been listed in this paragraph should
be studied in more detail by devoting a sub-level article to each of them, these sub-levels would instantiate exemplifications and by virtue of that be
in line with the procedure of drilling-down. That said, not all parts of this collection of articles are necessarily spawned in that way. New contents
that are not merely details belonging to what has been known before are expected to occur, although at this stage no method of how this can happen can
be stated.

The usual relationship between the levels is that the super-level logically follows from the sub-level 
(at least the corresponding section in the super-level does). The examples
of deaggregation of numbers and causal disease pathways illustrate that, given one can imagine that these relations will be mirrored
at some point in pairs of articles of this collection. The numbers at a regional level imply the numbers at state level, and an
effective causal pathway implies the causal connection between an exposome and the disease, while the reverse in both cases is not given. Similar logical
relations obtain between viewing a geographic map on different levels of details and between the exposition of a story and its representation in the form
of its summary. There is no clear-cut methodology that could be reasonably prescribed when drilling down into a sublevel. In some cases, when we zoom
into details that should give us a causal explanation of observed phenomena, something like the hypothetico-deductive method suggests itself. That 
method allows the exploration of the space of possible causal explanations, and if we give some credit to one specific explanation, the constraint that
must be satisfied is that the observed phenomena must follow from it (i.e., the super-level should follow from the sub-level). However, cybernetics
should not be obsessed with methods, nor with contents. New ideas should be allowed to occur on sublevels, but some connection to the root level 1 
should be traceable, otherwise we are not dealing with the cybernetic project anymore.

In contrast to drilling down into a part of a model, the switch from the first- to the third-person perspective changes the quality of the 
observables. The decision of the subject to take action, as well as the meaning of a piece of information as it appears to
the subject, cannot be made intersubjectively accessible. A consequence of this is the atomicity between a decision and a direct action, and between
the bearer of a piece of information and its meaning as perceived by the subject. A drill-down into this relation in order to provide a more
detailed view of it is not possible. Therefore this switch of perspective, which can be called "objectfication", is a logical accompaniment to
the switch that is given by drilling down.
</span></p>
<p class=PGStandard style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB>
Next to drilling down and objectification other kinds of associations are expected to occur, which are "less analytical" than the other two. 
Synthesis, the creation of completely new ideas are necessary to break out of the sandbox set by level 1. These are expected to come from 
1.2.1 or one of its sub-levels, but that is to be seen during the course of the project.
