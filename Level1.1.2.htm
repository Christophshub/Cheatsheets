An experience can be shared among several observers. Imagine a group of people looking
at a car. The car is physically present, and everyone present at the scene would confirm
this fact. And the confirmations of the <i>different observers</i> would refer to <i>the same car</i>.
In this very sense the scene generates <i>the experience</i> (singular), which the different 
observers share among each other. In another sense, the scene generates several experiences (plural), of which
one is unique to each observer. Everyone sees the car at a slightly different angle. There might be
colour-blind people within the group. And the view might entail different emotional associations
with the object. In this
sense each observer has its own experience which he does not share with anyone else.</span></p>
<p class=PGStandard style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB>
More extreme cases of subjective experience are those involving physical pain. Whereas an object,
e.g. a sharp object penetrating my skin, can be observed intersubjectively, I cannot share with anyone the
experience of my physical pain that I am suffering from due to the presence of the object. All that
can be done is creating a similar experience of pain, which I could inflict on another observer.
I could share with this observer a belief that our experiences are similar, but they would still be different.
Adopting a more precise language, it is always the case that experiences of different observers are 
different, since even if we speak of one experience the identity of experience is properly speaking 
the identity of the intersubjectively observable object that the different experiences refer to.
</span></p>
<p class=PGStandard style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB>
What are the characteristics of intersubjective experience as opposed to subjective experience? It refers
to objects that are physically trackable and whose identity turns on persistence through a certain period
of time. The intersubjective aspects of the conceptual pair of information and causation are information
channels and causal mechanisms, respectivey. The different parts of an information channel are relay stations,
where information is received in one form and passed on to the next station in possibly another form. Causal
mechanisms are basically engaged in the same business as information channels, but we tend to speak of mechanisms
in a causal context, when we want to know what effect will follow from the presence of a cause. In informational
contexts, we are often interested in the question what a signal tells us about the event that has happened before,
at the source of a channel. There is no a priori reason to assume that any part of an information channel or of
a causal mechanism should not be open to observation for different observers. Also, there is no a priori
reason to assume that it should not be possible to perform <a href="Level1.3.htm"><span style='color:#7030A0'>
the drill-down operation of Level 1.3</span></a> in order to analyse a link between two relay stations or two
parts of a causal mechanism in more detail, in particular such that additional relay stations or parts of 
the mechanism are disclosed.</span></p>
<p class=PGStandard style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB>
But isn't the experience of a physical object by an observer the passing of physically trackable information 
from the object to the observer? If this should be so, where does the privacy of the subjective experience
come from? It is again decisive to be clear about what aspect of the problem one is looking at. To track 
the information processing of a human observer during the perception of a physical object leads to a chain
of operations performed by intersubjectively accessible parts of an information channel, whose ultimate part
will be an observable reaction performed by the observer of the object. And one would probably miss the
identification of some kind of central
stage in the brain where the meaning of the signal is determined. If the same analysis is done under a 
reversal of the temporal direction, starting with the observable reaction to the exposure to the object and heading
backwards in the causal chain, in order to determine the central place in brain where the decision to react is taken, 
then one will probably miss that stage and eventually end up at the light-emitting
object that supposedly caused the reaction, and so again one would by-pass what one was actually looking for. The reason for these mistakes is that the objective
approach misses the "I" and its specific experiential realm by confining itself to intersubjective 
objects that qualify as and are permitted as possible parts of an explanation of how perception works.
</span></p>
<p class=PGStandard style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB>
Of course, the admittance of "I" does not in itself explain why we have private experiences in the specific way we have
them, or the impression of having taken a genuine decision and thereby becoming originators of a new causal chain of events.
These problems remain complex even if we allow language that includes subjective terms. 
Nor does taking this step help us in attaining the results one would expect when following a scientific agenda that explicitly seeks to analyse
perception under objective terms. But it does help in highlighting that one must be careful not to mix
two different worlds of experience into one language. Once cannot explain subjective aspects of an experience, e.g.
the qualia of colour, but at the same time exlude the subjective concepts from an explanatory
framework. If these concepts <i>are</i> allowed, we see the effects immediately by the dissolution 
of several problems that vex the analysis of information of causation, for example certain problems 
involving conceptual regress or circularity (see <a href='http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11245-014-9255-6' 
target='_blank'>An informational perspective on agency causation</a>).
When causation is anchored in <i>agency</i>, then the original association is not between one intersubjectively
observable variable and another, as many other approaches to causation want to have it, but between a decision to act and the 
action itself. The decision itself can be experienced only subjectively and is not intersubjectively observable. The
relation thus holds between two qualitatively different kind of relata, and this relation does <i>not</i> allow us to
do a drill-down into a finer grained level of modelling: in acting, human agents decide to move their body. They do <i>not</i> 
decide to do something such that subsequently their body moves. Similarly, we perceive a sound an object makes, but we do
<i>not</i> perceive our vibrating eardrums or other relay-stations. Hence, the relation obtains directly between subjective experience and the perceived
object, and likewise the original causal relation obtains directly between the decision to act and the movement of the 
body. A drill-down is then possible only by dropping the subjective terms of experience and decision and replacing them by their objective 
counterparts, by which we relapse into a language based on observable correlations. Thus, when we allow subjective terms
into our explanatory framework, there simply is no problem of regress or circularity, neither in the problem of analysing
causation nor in the problem of analysing information.
