We can perceive ourselves as agents who are free to choose any one
out of several options to act, given all of those are within our reach.
This belief itself makes a difference to our willingness to probe the range
of options available to us in order to improve our situation. That we are
"free" to choose can hardly be proved. Only one option will actually be 
executed, and if records of that action are taken, then one could argue
that the action had been determined to be taken by the agent in that 
situation, given one finds other records of the past that suggest a 
causal connection between the events reported about in those records 
and the action taken by the agent. But the fact that one action has been committed is no
proof that other actions had not been genuine alternative options for
the agent at the time of the action. Actually, none of the two positions can be proved. So we are
left with the belief that, while the past is fact-based, the future presents
itself to us as open and manipulable, and this belief will make us actually
try to engage in such manipulations to our advantage. As far as cybernetic
philosophy is concerned, is makes no difference whether that belief itself
has to have its origins in a free decision. It is sufficient that one holds it.
That shows that the proactive approach of maintaining a self-model of oneself
as a free agent does not necessarily contradict a belief in determinism.
But belief is not objectifiable. It resides in my first-person perspective. 
In particular, my belief in future possible states of the universe implies
a prospective stance that stands in stark contrast to the retrospective 
way of looking at facts. Facts can concern general truths, or they can relate 
to particular events of the past. The position that the future
consists of facts as well is difficult to defend, since, as opposed to the
past, there are no records of future events. One can only make an indirect
argument: once the future has turned into present and then past, then there 
can be records of it, and therefore the events turn out to be facts. Again 
it seems there is a kind of stand-off in arguing in favour or against 
the reality of free will. But these metaphysical questions do not require a
definite answer for the evaluation of the epistemic position of the cybernetic
agent. For the agent and its task of 
evaluating actions that are supposed to influence future situations,
a prospective stance commands itself. This prospective stance is nothing else
but the aforementioned belief in an open and manipulable future, and this belief
resides in the subjective perspective.
