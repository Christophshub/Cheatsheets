<h2>Article collection "Cybernetic philosophy"</h2>
<br>
<p class=PGStandard><span lang=EN-GB>Level 1</span></p>
<p class=PGStandard style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB>
This is a collection of articles outlining a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics' 
target='_blank'>cybernetic</a> approach to philosophy. Cybernetics is the study of teleological, or goal-driven
structures. Accordingly, cybernetic philosophy studies living organisms and artifical agents
as far as their goal-driven behaviour is concerned. This first article ("Level 1") starts with 
a list of common-sensical observations, which will all turn out to revolve around cybernetic principles. 
<a class=threeprinciples href="#threeprinciples">The three principles</a> considered in this top-level article are: the dichotomy of subjects and objects, 
the interlocking of problems and purposes, and top-down thinking. The respective sub-levels of Level 1,
all rooted in one of the three principles, will then delve into further details of cybernetics and will
explain why those common-sensical insights do obtain.</span></p>

<p class=PGStandard style='text-align:justify' lang="EN-GB">
We stand in relation to a world where things, in general, don't run
in our favour. Hence the necessity to intervene.
To be able to perform goal-directed interventions, 
<a href="Level1.3.htm"><span style='color:#7030A0'>
we have to create models of the world with various degrees of generality.</span></a>
<a href="Level1.2.htm"><span style='color:#AA7000'> We have different purposes that change in time and across
the levels of interaction with our environment,</span></a> 
<a href="Level1.1.htm"><span style='color:#0090D0'> and we
can view ourselves as perceiving and acting subjects, but also as objects like we see other objects in the
world, that is, from an external perspective.</span></a>
<a href="Level1.2.htm"><span style='color:#AA7000'> The
primary goal of any goal-driven entity is self-preservation, 
since if this goal is not achieved, all other goals the entity 
might pursue will be nullified as well. Self-preservation, or survival, depends on 
informed action. </span></a> That is because,
next to having a general understanding of a type of situation, an action also
needs to take into account the specificities of a concrete situation in order to be
efficacious. Informed action thus requires an agent both to measure the contingent state of the
world, <a href="Level1.3.htm"><span style='color:#7030A0'>and to model the world, such that the outcome of all the
possible actions can be predicted</span> </a>
<a href="Level1.2.htm"><span style='color:#AA7000'>and the best of these,
according to purpose, can be selected.</span></a>
<a href="Level1.3.htm"><span style='color:#7030A0'>Models can have various forms
and various levels of detail</span></a><a href="Level1.2.htm"><span
style='color:#AA7000'>, and the selection for application of one of these
depends on the specific goals of the situation and the situation itself</span></a>.
<a href="Level1.3.htm"><span style='color:#7030A0'>Sometimes we have to 
look very closely at the circumstances before taking action</span></a><a
href="Level1.2.htm"><span style='color:#AA7000'>, and often this closer looks
depends on the goal that we are pursuing.</span></a>
A good model can help an agent in predicting the
development of events. In order to do this, the current conditions, as they are present in the environment of the agent,
must be fed into the model after an observation or a measurement, whereupon a prediction in accordance with the constraints
of the model can be calculated. 
Such a model can also spare an agent to some extent the costs of repetitively observing 
subsequent states of affairs again and again, since the facts
can be delivered by the model instead. 
<a href="Level1.2.htm"><span style='color:#AA7000'>Goal-driven entities,
like ourselves, therefore
have to trade the costs of building and operating a more complex predictive model 
against the costs of observing contingent facts.</span></a>
<a href="Level1.1.htm"><span style='color:#0090D0'>
If we are ourselves part of a premeditated future situation, 
we have to assume a dual perspective on ourselves - we can view ourselves
as causal objects, which are parts of the unfolding of events, and as agents 
that will perceive and act in the future situation. From the perspective of 
the agent, acting essentially means starting a 
new strand of causal chains, whereas to perceive means to assign a meaning
to a signal or a symbol.</span></a> 
The necessity to
act arises from a precarious situation we are in. Apart from some rare
situations where things naturally evolve in our favour, we have to face two
particular forms of constraints that Wiener <a href="#WienerHumanUseOfHumanBeings">[1]</a>
called the &quot;Augustinian devil&quot;, i.e.
the entropic environment of growing disorder, and the &quot;Manichean devil&quot;, an environment that comprises
other conscious agents that represent competition for the rivalrous and excludable goods. 
<a href="Level1.2.htm"><span style='color:#AA7000'>The interactions in both kinds of
environments, in order to be successful, have to be informed.</span></a>
The measurement of a contingent state is a reduction of uncertainty, and it
prepares for the actual action. <a
href="Level1.2.htm"><span style='color:#AA7000'>Performing the actual action in
reality should lead to acquiring a certain good (e.g. money, food, or information that helps acquiring
certain goods in future situations). These goods are the contents of the agent's goals.</span></a> 
The status of an acquired thing or brought-about situation as a goal can sometimes be
explained objectively. <a href="Level1.1.htm"><span style='color:#0090D0'>But sometimes we can attribute value and therefore the status of
desirability plainly in virtue of our first-person perspective, e.g. when a certain
token evokes emotive memories, or when our taste values one type of art higher
than another.</span></a> It is in an ever changing world in which we have to seek our goals.
<span style='color:#0070C0'><a href="Level1.1.htm"><span    
style='color:#0090D0'> We also change</span></a> </span><span style='color:#AA7000'><a
href="Level1.2.htm"><span style='color:#AA7000'>(and have to change in order to adapt),</span></a>
</span><a href="Level1.1.htm"><span
style='color:#0090D0'>both from the first-person perspective (my memory seen
from the inside changes, i.e. my personal history comprising all my past interactions
with the world changes), and seen from the third-person perspective (my
body-structure, including my brain, changes).</span></a> In all that, information plays 
a pivotal role. Information is always information <i>about</i> something, 
therefore it is a relative term. And information always needs a physical underpinning as
a carrier. Any physical structure is not information per se, but information can supervene
on it, and so information coexists with the physical stuff that carries
it. Written pieces of paper, or the way my neurons are connected, are records
of, or information about, past events. If these are to become active<i> as information</i>,
they must be read, or accessed, in some way. Thinking about a past event 
activates structures in the
brain that have stored the past, and thereby the occurrences of past
physical reality can become physically efficacious once more via
this semantic pathway.<a href="Level1.1.htm"><span style='color:#0090D0'> 
With semantically enabled agents like ourselves, information
processing during perception of some objects in the environment involves the
activation of past experiences with a similar situation. If we see a cat, we
think about past experiences with cats. The same happens if we see a
photographic image of a cat, a painted cat, and anything lying on the
continuous line towards a maximally abstract but still recognizable symbol for
cats. In the case of symbols the activated content becomes the &quot;meaning&quot; of that
symbol. Meaning exists depending on the first-person perspective.</span></a><span
style='color:#0070C0'> </span>But meanings in a proper sense can come into their own only if <i>types</i>
of things are formed epistemically on the basis of individuals that are exemplars of
these types<a href="Level1.2.htm"><span
style='color:#AA7000'>. If the types are relevant for modelling purposes, they 
often receive a dedicated denotation, e.g. a pictographical symbol or
a linguistic expression.</span></a><a
href="Level1.3.htm"><span style='color:#7030A0'> Causal models, for
mechanical   situations, require causal types. These are causally
relevant properties that the things bear.</span></a><a
href="Level1.2.htm"><span style='color:#AA7000'> As acting agents embodied in 
this world, we cannot help but "slicing up the environment of our experience" 
into processable parts, and this slicing will be relative to our possibility 
to actually use these compartmentalizations for causal interactions</span></a><a
href="Level1.3.htm"><span style='color:#7030A0'> - or at least construct linguistic models
such that our language can address the situation in an explanatory way, in
particular, by making sense of the situation by causally relevant properties
and their instantiation in the current situation.</span></a><a href="Level1.1.htm"><span
style='color:#0090D0'>
The agency-based view on causation is dual: the first-person perspective
on ourselves as agents allows an action to start a new strand of causal history,
and thereby to realise one of several possibilities, but if we evaluate 
the totality of past events with hindsight, it appears that everything might be part 
of one causal nexus where everything has happened with necessity.
Assuming the right one of these two perspectives at the right time is decisive from a cybernetic 
viewpoint. One can well espouse the principle of determination but still conceptualize
oneself as a subject capable of acting and making a difference, while refraining from doing
so can lead to inertia and fatalism.</span></a> Cybernetics is a paradoxical subject matter
in that its contents often have a high degree of abstraction while being essentially 
a theory about <i>acting</i>. If we practise cybernetics as a technical disciplin,
we have to deal with <a href="Level1.2.htm"><span style='color:#AA7000'>concepts like 
control circuits, information processing, adaptation, and requisite variety.</span></a> 
<a href="Level1.3.htm"><span style='color:#7030A0'>The required
perspectival changes needed to study the control circuits and alike cybernetical structures
are the drill-down procedure, a vertical change of view that allows to zoom in to and
out of the details of a structure. Complementarily, there is the switch between the
first- and the third-person perspective, which cannot be reduced to a simple drilling down.
</span></a> But there is more involved if we practise cybernetics as a <i>philosophical</i> discipline.
Doing this commands us to seek for a higher goal than mastering control circuits and elevating the
levels of empowerment to degrees where we might be ever more resilient against disturbances
while in the end not achieving something new. This outlook might give us quite a dismal picture of 
reality, but we have to consider that it is merely the outlook from our present point of
view. Therefore <i>growth</i> is the first target we have to head for, in order to then
leave our precarious situation. That will be the level where possibly the whole of 
cybernetics can be discharged and a new philosophy can take over.</p>

First principle: subject-object-dualism. <b>The first principle takes into account 
and fully embraces the
conceptual asymmetry between considering oneself as a subject and considering
oneself as an object (the first- and the third-person perspective), a distinction without
which it is unlikely that seeking to attain a goal has any meaning.</b>
The first-person perspective gives us the concept of "I", which is fundamentally
different from all our "objects" a given thinker can think about, or a given speaker can speak about.
This perspective also gives us
meaningful information and understanding. It likewise unlocks experiencing actions, 
directly following the subject's own decision. It gives us a direct
intuition of why things are considered valuable, and it spurs a 
proactive approach to shaping the world according to our wants.</span></a></span></p>

<a href="Level1.2.htm">
<span style='color:#AA7000'>Second principle: interlocking of 
problems and purposes.What guides the description of what a
cybernetic agent does, as well as what guides the development of a structured
outline of cybernetic philosophy, is an interlocking of problem-structure with
purpose-structure. If a problem of any kind is encountered, a cybernetic agent
allocates resources to solve the problem only if the problem is realistically
solvable and if its solution is relevant to the agent. The basic-level
problem is that of regulation, which is the recalibration of a system after
suffering from disturbances of its state. But there are higher-level problems
to be solved that ideally empower the agent to unlock new situations
and its subsequent problems, from which the agent had been excluded beforehand
due to residing in an inferior state. <b>This
principle takes into account the idea that cybernetics is in its core about solving
problems. It also acknowledges that a superior way of solving problems is overcoming
them, by allowing the agent to grow from lower states 
to higher states of empowerment.</b></span></a></span></p>

(3)
</span></a>
<a href="Level1.3.htm"><span style='color:#7030A0'>
Third principle: top-down thinking. The cybernetic way of 
modelling things is to start from a vague idea of control and from
there move into deeper levels of understanding step by step. Experiences and
insights are structured into a map of knowledge; 
the philosophy underlying cybernetics follows a top-down approach that is to be distinguished from
an approach of unstructured, free-floating ideas on the one hand, but also from 
a strict bottom-up approach on the other hand, which tries to ground all domains 
of knowledge firmly on a kind of <i>first philosophy</i>. Unlike a 
first-philosophy-approach, the principle of top-down thinking starts from intuitive and almost 
uncontroversial ideas of control and then aims to
explain how a drill-down into more specific details of a subject matter can be done (complemented
by (2), which explains <i>why</i>
we might want to do this). <b>This principle captures both
cybernetics' aspiration of achieving a certain amount of unification across different
domains of knowledge and its pragmatic stance, which dictates that the resolution of
some piece of knowledge into further details should be motivated by some purpose.</b>

The third principle, top-down thinking, 
will often be applied across this collection of articles in the form of "drilling-down" into a 
part of an article such that one thereby navigates to another article that 
expounds the said part in more detail. In this first article of the collection, 
I have highlighted the idea by colour-coding the ideas revolving around each 
principle. The "drilling-down" is implemented by hypertext links that forward 
to the next level of detail. By this means you will get to "Level 1.1" by clicking 
the blue text (subject-object-dualism), to "Level 1.2" by clicking the tanned 
text (interlocking of problems and purposes), and to "Level 1.3" by clicking 
the purple text (top-down thinking). Applying thus (3) to itself, we get a drilled-down 
description of the process of drilling-down (in other words a description 
of this top-down approach). Accordingly, the Level 1.1 document is the
result of applying the idea of (3) to the contents of (1), and its contents in 
turn would be a more detailed description
of the relation between the first- and the third person perspective. (See 
<a href='http://uhra.herts.ac.uk/handle/2299/16480' target='_blank'>my PhD 
dissertation</a> for such a description applied to the two fundamental concepts of information and causation)
Level 1.2 further analyses the idea of cybernetic empowerment and growth, and
allows to dive into further details described in Level 1.2.1, 1.2.2 etc. However,
not all articles that are derived by some other article are necessarily spawned
from zooming into details of the parent article. If new ideas are synthesized, the
scope of drilling down is thereby disrupted, and that is exactly would the goal
of this collection of articles tries to achieve. During
all of this, one always has to be clear about what one is actually talking
about, e.g. whose growth one is describing or analysing. In principle, this document
is applicable both to human readers and learners who want to understand
certain problem-structures better, and also to a synthetically created AI, given 
one allows for a sufficiently high degree of abstraction.
