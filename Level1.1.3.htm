<h3 align='center'>The "I" as the center of gravity of subjective experience</h3>
<br>
<p class=PGStandard style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB>
<a href='Level1.1.2.htm'>Level 1.1.2</a> explains the difference between subjective and intersubjective
experience. The specific way in which I perceive a given object, or the way I experience bodily sensations of mine, are 
exclusive to other observers. Similarly, the experience of an action that I perceive as <i>my own action</i>
is private and exclusive. But the size of "I" is bigger than the size of these experiences localised in a
specific space and time. The "I" has a unity and identity across periods of time that can span a long series of impressions and interactions.
If we look at a scene, defined as a series of interactions with a final state, it will always be the case that if this scene 
is reported by an involved subject, this subject will simply refer to itself as "I" across the whole scene, without having to 
account for why the implied unity and identity of "I" will hold true, a task which, if taken in a very strict sense, 
is much less trivial if it refers to an inter-subjectively perceivable object that was 
part of scene. Of course, in pragmatic contexts the "problem of identity" concerning the other objects involved in the scene
will most likely not be expounded as well, but whereas this problem could hypothetically turn out to be
problematic if expounded, this is not true for the case of the subject. The attribution of unity and identity
to myself is original and unproblematic, if I refer to myself as a subject. If, at the beginning of the said scene, I am
asked what I see, I can say: "<i>I</i> see if object X, and <i>I</i> am going to do Y, in order to bring about the target state Z, which
<i>I</i> (now) think it will be beneficial to <i>me</i> once the target state is reached." The "I" here refers to different
stages of the projected time-span, but I do not have to account for the maintenance of the identiy across time since I just attribute it to myself
in virtue of my first-person perspective. The same holds true if I am asked again, once the target state is reached, and
I am prompted to account for the course of events in retrospect. "<i>I</i> saw X, and so <i>I</i> did Y in order to bring
about Z, which <i>I</i> can now benefit from." If these statements would have been made referring to <i>another</i> entity
that putatively perceives object X, and subsequently does Y, and enjoys a certain pay-off from the final state Z, then it
is in principle a more difficult kind of problem to ascertain the identity and unity of the involved entity, and subsequently
to justify the imputation of an intentional stance to that entity. It is striking to note that the problems of unity
and identity are intimately connected to the problem of judging sentient intelligence. When, in contrast to sentient
agents, we only deal with information channels and mechanisms performing a certain function, then unity and identity
is irrelevant at any level of description of the considered process. All that counts is that the part of the overall
mechanism currently active is the bearer of certain causal properties or dispositions, such that the causal function is
fulfilled. But if that part is again involved at a later stage of the process, it is simply irrelevant whether it 
is really the <i>same</i> part or a substitute that bears the same properties and therefore performs the same
function as the said original part. There is no observable difference from the third-person perspective, in 
striking difference to the course of events that concern the witnessing subject. Or consider the following examples 
involving an experiencing subject in different kinds of interactions that highlight the importance of "I" as the center of gravity of
subjectivity. Imagine I am pushed coincidentally by an object and my body performs a certain movement forward. Now 
there is a second instance where I move forward in approximately the same manner, but because someone called 
me forward. In the first instance, my body moves as a whole just like in the second instance, but only due to 
a transfer of momentum at one coincidental part of my body and due to
the physical property of cohesiveness of the atoms that are part of my body. In the second instance, my body
moves as a whole because my body follows the centralised decision to react since "I", a person with a unique
history, have been addressed by another person, in expectation of a series of interactions (e.g a conversation) with that person
that require the imputation of unity and identiy across time, both regarding myself and that other person.

The capacity of information processing is just a very partial capacity of being able
to maintain "higher-level thoughts", i.e. thoughts of the subject that feature the subject itself explicitly. Some 
philosophers are convinved that consciousness is connected to the capacity of maintaining higher-level thoughts, such as
the proposition "I think, therefore I am". If an entity does not utter propositions involving itself, at least not in a convincing
manner, then one faces the problem of judging the capacity of maintaining higher-level thoughts from a third-person 
perspective. Since this capacity (most likely) includes the capacity of information processing and genuine goal-oriented
acting, we can formulate similar preconditions to a structure capable of maintaining higher-level thoughts like those
conditions required for information processing and acting. It must
be able to entertain a model of itself and relate itself to the context in which it is speaking of itself. But since
all information processing needs a physical underpinning, the
capacity of maintaining higher-level thoughts requires a certain complexity of structure, which needs to be physically
represented as well, and which forbids a shortcutting of stimulus and response, in order to leave room for the
required processing of information involving the self-model.

If an agent capable of the experience of agency commits an action and is subsequently prompted to account for why
it thinks the action has happened, there is no need to go beyond the level of detail that the association of its decision
and the observable action features. Any drill-down into further details of the causal process does not concern agency
anymore, but certain physiological details of signal propagation that need to be described in a different language that
dispenses with the agency-scheme. In a similar manner, as far as the experiencing subject is concerned, it makes little 
sense to prompt the subject to account for its first-person perspective of experiencing an object of perception. From the
subject's first-person perspective, this just happens without further ado. And there is a third instance concerning
the subject and its doings where we can delve into a language based on mere correlations to try to explain what is
happening. This concerns the attribution of values to an outcome. Sometimes, a target state bears a certain relation
to another target state. For example, we might be willing to pay money in the course of one causal interaction in order to
acquire information that might help us to do the right thing in another, future interaction. But paying money reduces
our utility, and so the fact that we are willing to pay it can only be explained if there is more to be gained
in the future situation, such that the loss can be compensated. Such a dependency can not always be found. In 
target situations that have no rapport with other target situations, it is either the case that an objective utility can
be attached to them, e.g. a financial return that can be measured in units of currency, or a utility has no intersubjective
measurement scale. But again in these cases a subject can attribute a value tout court, by asserting that the state 
bears a subjective value, e.g. when
a piece of art meets the taste of the subject. Similar to the analysis of the origin of an intervention performed by
an agent, one might decide to further track the origins of the attribution of the value to the target state, but this 
changes the perspective and does not invalidate the originality of the value-attribution performed by the subject. 
</span></p>

The intersubjective measurement scale of money is advantageous in many context. In the cybernetic
context, it is relevant to the implementation of an automated <a href="Level1.2.2.htm">control circuit</a>, since
the control unit needs an objective basis for its selection of the "best" of all possible actions. The actions themselves
often have costs atttached to them and the same holds true for the expected target state following from the action. Those can
either have pay-offs or opportunity costs, such that the optimisation to be performed by the control unit becomes a
straight-forward comparison of monetary values. However, when the cost of action has to be squared with a desirability
of a target state that lacks a corresponding cost, then that value has to be asserted by the subject suffering from 
or benefitting from the target state. For example, there might be an action available for avoiding pain, and with this
action comes a cost. Now the avoidance of pain needs the attribution of a positive value (or negative cost) to compensate
the cost of action. While it is possible to do that and thus pain-avoidance has seemingly acquired an 
objectively measurable value, the place where values actually reside is on the side of subjectivity. That is because,
if we attach a price tag to pain-avoidance, the question we actually ask is "how big is my subjective pain when losing X amount
of money, compared to the pain I would suffer from when not spending it?", rather than the question "how much worth is the
pain-avoidance in monetary terms?" 
</span></p>
<p class=PGStandard style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB>
When judging the desirability of a target state there are often complicated relations to be considered between
the possible actions and their ramifications, the target states themselves and their relation to other target
states. An agent can decide to suffer a loss in one situation if that helps to increase the probabilities of
greater gains in the future. Often money and information play the roles of intermediators across different 
situations. These relations will be dealt with on Level 1.2 and its sub-levels. As far as the question of
subjectivity is concered, a final remark on values concerns the tracking of dependences of some target states
on other target states. Often, chains of dependences terminate in the interest an agent has in maintaining
its own state, i.e. self-preservation. Self-preservation can be "justified" in a purely logical manner by
pointing to the fact that almost all other goals an agent can pursue depend on the agent's self-preservation.
But this, of course, does not give us any information about the source of desirability of these other goals,
and most likely, if we pursue that question, there will be futher "buck-passing" all the way down. It 
seems more probable that it is a brute fact that entities like biological organims seek to preserve themselves
and that the source of desirability of self-preservation cannot be further tracked. But if this should be so,
then we need subjectivity as the decisive breaker of symmetry for this argument to make sense. Of all
agents in the world, it is <i>myself</i> that I want to preserve, although I can well view myself 
from a third-person perspective, such that from that perspective I am one agent out of a billion others.
But from my more primordial first-person perspective, this symmetry vanishes and the multiplicity of
agents is reduced to a unity that I naturally want preserve.
