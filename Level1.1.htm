The dichotomy between subjects and objects is fundamental. For this outline of cybernetic philosophy, it is relevant in several aspects, which, however, do not cover
the full range of importance that this dichotomy bears. The list of aspects relevant to the limited context of cybernetics in the sense of the study of interaction of
a teleological system with its environment covers the following points: the difference between interventional and observational 
statistical data, the difference between 
intersubjective and subjective experience, the pertinance of "I" as the center of gravity in the study of control and empowerment, and finally the significance
of subjective experience for overcoming fatalism. There are both epistemological and ethical aspects which necessitate the distinction between subjective and objective
notions.

<i>Interventional and observational statistical data: </i>Correlated observables that represent distinct entities are a hint that a direct or indirect causal link obtains between
the two observables. The problem is that by observation alone we do not know the direction of the causal connection, at least not from the bare fact of the correlation
itself. Also, the causal link might be established by the presence of a common (in the sense of shared) cause between the two observed entities, while staying
itself unobserved and therefore not lying within the scope of analysis. Interventional data, on the other hand, do provide us with the knowledge of the direction
of the causal link, if we are free to intervene on both observables. Assuming a strictly skeptical perspective, interventional data count only as such if we
have <i>ourselves</i> performed such an intervention. <a href="Level1.1.1.htm">Level 1.1.1</a> analyses mathematically the evaluation of such "agent probabilities" which are derived from the act
of manipulating a system, and they are contrasted with the "observational probabilities" if the agent is confined to the role of mere observer.

<i>Subjective and intersubjective experience: </i>A closely related point, which is highly relevant to the conceptual analysis of information and causation, is
the strict semantic discontinuity between intersubjective and subjective experience. This can be demonstrated based on the conceptual twins of information and causation.
Both terms can be analysed by just taking into account their intersubjective aspects - information channels and causal mechanisms. This intersubjective, or objective, view
can cover some ground but fails to account for the complete meaning of these terms. Both require a complementary, subjective view, which covers respectively the aspect
of semanticisation (understanding) of an information signal by a semantic agent, and the aspect of action executed by the agent who manipulates a system and therefore
the course of events that an unfolding of a situation can take. <a href="Level1.1.2.htm">Level 1.1.2</a> describes the conceptual distinctions in more detail.

<i>Pertinance of "I": </i>The conceptual circle of concepts of cybernetics requires a center of gravity, which is the "I". Cybernetics is the study of teleological
systems, and it is highly doubtful that any sense can be made of a teleological system without a, or better, <i>the</i> subjective notion of "I". Achieving a goal
in the face of an adverse environment requires measuring of information and its evaluation, possibly also its aggregation over time, it requires planning, trial and error
in possibly many iterations, and sometimes promises a reward that reaches its beneficiary in a possibly likewise asynchronous manner. This elapse in time requires us
to make sense of the identitiy of the information recipient, the planner, the experimenter, and finally the beneficiary of all these doings. Again, under a
strictly philosophical stance this task of making sense of identity is a highly non-trivial one. But not so if we allow for the subjective notion of "I", which 
integrates all the asynchronous tokens as it were automatically, without the requirement of any skills of analysis or synthesis. As opposed to all other objects,
we can not only observe ourselves but we also <i>are</i> ourselves. "I" is the word that expresses this fundamental breaker of symmetry with regard to the two
modes of experience. This will be explained in more detail on <a href='Level1.1.3.htm'>Level 1.1.3</a>.

<i>Overcoming fatalism: </i>Again regarding "perspective", but this time with a stronger ethical than epistemological impact, we have to allow for the subjective stance
in order to overcome fatalism. There is only one course of time, therefore one can say at any point in time that everything has happened in a deterministic manner, without
the chance of being disproven. But one cannot draw from this the conclusion that one can yield to fatalism as far as the future course of the universe is concerned. Here
is the point where the whole cybernetic philosophy can make a real difference. According to its conceptual toolbox, in evaluating a situation based on information about
the situation I have the option of committing to different options of acting. This will, as far as my knowledge about the future unfolding of events reaches, entail
good things or bad things, and I am in this sense free to behave accordingly. So, believing in the cybernetic stance can make a difference - although cybernetics itself
is not safe from raising the above argument of determinism against it. An agent could have been determined to believe in cybernetics in the first place, but disproving 
this point is not the concern of cybernetics. The concern of cybernetics is that the agent will be well off - and it will definitely be better off if it believes in 
cybernetics than if it yields to fatalism. <a href='Level1.1.4.htm'>Level 1.1.4</a> expounds further details of this argument.
