The contents of Level 1 spin off Level 1.3 as a reflection of the idea of drill-down itself, and they
spin off 1.1 and 1.2 by drilling down into the two other major propositions of Level 1. Given 1.2 lays out
the importance of achieving purposes and reaching goals, this Level 1.2.1 can be considered as
born from applying the question of purpose to maintaining and pursuing a complex goal system in the first place, and 
to its reflection in the form of this document collection about cybernetic philosophy.
This article defends the value of both and argues that the practical and the 
theoretical aspects involved are interlocked and provide a two-pronged solution.
</span></p>

Cybernetic philosophy promotes an active development towards continuous expansion of one's range of empowerment. 
This needs to be
done in order to protect our existence and to increase its quality. Our existence, which initially is not something
we choose to have or not, is usually valued by us, no matter whether we see a deeper meaning in it or not.
While thereby opting for further existing, the subsequent question is whether we actively want to
extend it, both temporally and in the sense of an extended range of empowerment. Approaching this question,
one can say with justification that who values existence today
will also value it tomorrow. But who values it tomorrow, so argues cybernetic philosophy, should also value
it in ten years, in a hundred years, and then indefinitely, except if there are good arguments 
against that. There is evidence
that regarding this question we are at the brink of a turning point in history that makes it
much more worthwile to seek the extension of our lifes beyond the given biological lifespan, because the 
advantages of it outweigh the arguments against doing so.
Studying cybernetics theoretically and abiding by its recommendations in the practical sphere 
make our existence less precarious. By the means of technology we can shield us from 
more and more disturbances that affect us in different ways. There are the necessities that
we have to deal with in an entropic world. Cybernetics recommends delegating the 
required work to technological systems. Doing so helps us in the obvious way 
in that we thus get rid of time-consuming labour, in order to be free to contemplate 
more interesting questions and engage in more valuable activity. There are of course
also the significant disturbances of our essential variables like deadly diseases,
which likewise only technology helps us to overcome. As contributors to solving 
these problems, the practical aspects and the theoretical aspects of
cybernetics mutually sustain and fertilize each other.
Theory helps by prioritising and also by laying the foundations of 
implementing the technology needed for an improved practical life, but in return
there is feedback flowing from the experience of practise back into theory, correcting
its errors and making sure that the goal system we have set up for ourselves is an agile
one, growing and adapting itself both to the continuously changing environment and to
the change from the development of our own agency. In this endeavour we need to stay 
open-minded in order not to lose ourselves in a two narrowly scoped set of goals. Goals constantly
have to be reevaluated through time and among each other in the face of their often
conflicting nature. The return of undergoing these effords is an unforeseeable reward
in the future. The opportunity costs of not undergoing them is one of the most
important arguments for continuous and unconstrained development. The future is open to us,
and the rewards that wait for us on another level of development can only be seen
when we reach that level, but this is something we have to strive for in an active
manner. This is one of the plausible interpretations of the ethical principle 
of von Förster, who said 'I always act so as to increase the number of choices'.
This is thus the answer to the question of the value of the whole cybernetic
endeavour, which is raised in the first paragraph as the central theme of this article: 
It has value because it protects and extends our existence, which is itself deemed
valuable by the subject.
</span></p>
<p class=PGStandard style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB>
What is to be recommended if one espouses the spirit of the above paragraphs, is 
to pursue a path of holistic development, and to see that one's body as well as
one's mind is maintained at a sufficiently well-functioning level. Everyone
should find their own way in achieving this. But very likely, a good way
will be to practise a multi-pronged approach to holistic development, to study
philosophy, several languages, music, art, literature, in order to grasp, internalise, and
then personalize the intellectual contents that our global culture has to offer.
Then it will also be recommandable to develop one's technical skills, 
to study mathematics, to use the tools of information technology, and to 
try to develop a deeper understanding of the sciences. To complement these different
kinds of intellectual activities, one should try to stay healthy and develop an
interest in measures of anti-aging, because we need to buy ourselves as much time
as possible. And finally, it is a necessity to take into account the economic 
dimension, to try to develop skills that add value for other participants in
the market, and of course to deploy and market these skills (or other kinds
of value-adders). Without participating in the activity of exchanging added value,
in other words in earning and spending money, it will not be possible to 
invoke the services provided by others, and which are needed to attain the kinds 
of higher levels of complexity mentioned above.

The question of the <i>value</i> of existence and the ramifications of affirming it 
are of a more central importance for cybernetic philosophy than the question 
of the <i>meaning</i> of existence. 
Although the question of its meaning is therefore factored out of the central scope of cybernetic
philosophy, it might contribute something to that always lingering question as well.
Cybernetics has to tackle an intrinsic paradox. It is necessary to take
into account the constraints of our entropic environment, into which we are thrown
when we come into existence, and which make constant interventions necessary. But
we have also evolved into a higher-level existence in the sense that that level
enables us to reflect on these
necessities. We see abstractly that we are teleological entities that obviously
seek to achieve goals, but we don't see the goal that can be achieved by the overall
activity of constantly trying to achieve goals.
But, at yet another level of abstracting the things, we see that our evolution
has obviously enabled us to ask the question and ponder the paradox. 
In a way this can be also be considered as an example of successful empowerment.
Now we are living on at least three levels: the corporeal (our flesh-and-blood 
existence, without which it is game over for us), the practical 
(we live a concrete life as individual persons), and the theoretical 
(the level that supervenes on the former two and which gives us abstract thoughts).
Looking closer at the above empowerment, we see that the real qualitative change 
of evolution, which at some stage has enabled our to ponder questions of 
our existence, seems to have
a bearing mainly for the theoretical level of abstract thinking. The corporeal and the practical aspects
still deal with the old cybernetic issues of anticipating or reacting to
disturbances of certain states that are considered ideal. The change here, with
higher-level agents compared to lower-level agents, is just quantitative or one
of degree. By means of changes of our biology, e.g. evolving the neo-cortex, or
by means of changing the environment (making it more favourable to our needs, 
establishing certain forms of automation of interventions), 
we keep certain problems at a distance. However, most of the problems
do not go away definitely (e.g. hunger and thirst). It is just that they are
conveniently delegated to services which we invoke consciously (e.g. commissioning a
service from a company offering that service, turning on a machine, 
enquiring for a piece of information in the internet), 
or unconsciously (relying on the biological defense mechanisms provided to us by our immune system).
What might seem as surprising is that the qualitative change of being able to ask
questions revolving around our existence, a capacity which evolution has endowed us with, 
has arisen out of a mere quantitative change in the two lower levels (the corporeal,
and the practical). There are therefore a couple of arguments for why we can hope for 
further success when we continue to drive our evolutionary change forward and 
try to unlock further intellectual capacities:
</span></p>
<p class=PGStandard style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB>
1: There are genuine qualitative shifts regarding the meaning-of-life-question, like 
being able to ask the question in the first place at a certain stage of
evolutionary development. We have been endowed with that capacity, and this distinguishes 
us from other animals, while our thermodynamic processes are still basically like theirs.
</span></p>
<p class=PGStandard style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB>
2: We do have a conceptual distinction of meaningful and meaningless. To say that 
there is and there ever will 
be only meaninglessness even on higher stages of development with regards to the absolute sense of the 
concept is something we cannot be sure about – especially if we take argument 1.
</span></p>
<p class=PGStandard style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB>
3: Evolutionary changes in science and philosophy show that sometimes questions 
are asked in a different way than before and that problems sometimes just <i>vanish</i>
rather than being solved according to the sense in which they had been mooted at
the beginning of their examination. An example is the concept of the <i>infinitesimal</i>
in mathematics. It might be that life (or more generally existence) will appear 
in a completely new ligtht, by acquiring a not yet 
conceivable but then desirable quality that makes pursuing the question of 
meaningfulness really either just uninteresting to us, or even affects that project 
more fundamentally by making it clear that, from the then achieved higher perspective, 
a project had been pursued that asked an ill-posed question. This
argument thus adds another sense to argument 1: we necessarily have to 
arrive at that higher level to get the new perspective on the <i>question</i> itself, rather 
than just on the <i>answer</i> to a fixed question, as the combination of 1. and 2. seems to suggest
at the first sight.
</span></p>
<p class=PGStandard style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB>        
4: The arguments 1. to 3. do not provide a straight answer to the question of the
meaning of existence, taking into account that a promising answer could be linked to
a change of perspective that our current stage of development does not yet allow.
It therefore sets just an intermediate goal instead of outlining the final goal.
This is a "relative" solution that, however, can still be embraced despite 
its deficits since it arguably is still better than all the alternatives. It means that we
can postpone the question if there is hope that in the future we are in a better position 
than earlier, and we would not commit an error by doing so, since from the higher state
we could go back to the lower state if that should have any advantages whatsoever. 
The argument becomes viable 
once the perspective of controlled development of humanity becomes realistic, which it now 
seems to be. This solution thus is, in its generality, a pure application of a thought from cybernetics: 
try to expand your range of options, because this cannot be a bad thing to do (apart from 
the costs of undergoing the endeavour of acquiring them, whence the more analytical or
decision-theoretical 
than normative question of the chances of realising it).
</span></p>
<p class=PGStandard style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB>   
Development is thus not just a means to the end, i.e. to the end of being able to solve
the problem at the higher level of evolution, in the sense of arguments 1. and 2. 
Development could be itself part of 
solving the question, by making the problem disappear in the sense of argument
3. This in turn could happen "coincidentally", as has often been the case with
problems in the history of science and in the history of philosophy. But 
cybernetics is itself a framework for studying the different ways of solving
problems (solving them in the proper sense of the word vs. changing the context
in such a way that the problem becomes a non-problem, see Level 1.2.3 and its sub-levels
for details on the idea). So it could even be that cybernetics turns out to be a direct source
of solving the big problem of meaning, after it has studied itself sufficiently.
</span></p>
<p class=PGStandard style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB>
At the first sight, the cybernetic worldview offers merely a bleak outlook on our existence,
and presents it as a constant uphill struggle, which is impossible to overcome, given
our entropic universe, and which on top of that represents a meaningless activity
in the first place because there is no real goal. At the second sight, though, and as the
arguments above show, there is some reason in pursuing the kind of continuous development
that the cybernetic philosophy recommends, since development and empowerment are different from
mere constant change.
