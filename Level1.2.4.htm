Why do things in general not run in our favour in the first place? Why do our purposes not 
realize themselves on their own? The ultimately underlying physical cause of this are probably
the laws of thermodynamics, which govern how changes can happen in our physical world.
While the first law states that the internal energy of an isolated system is constant, the 
second law dictates that the entropy of an isolated system increases in the course of any
spontaneous change. Entropy is a measure of disorder of a system. Because of the second
law, any system left to itself has the tendency of deteriorating from order to disorder.
If the order is to be reestablished in the system, some intervention needs to be done from the outside
into the system. In physical terms, "work" is performed in those cases. If system A performs
work on system B, B's entropy can be reduced, which is not possible if B is left on its own.
But if we consider the whole system comprised just of A and B, the second law imposes the 
constraint that the entropy of the composed system must rise during the process. Since
B's entropy has been decreased, A's part of the entropy balance must have risen by at least
the same magnitude to enable the process. Due to the first law, the energy of the combined
system A + B stays the same, but the quality of its energy has declined in the course of
the process. The share of 
the internal energy that can perform work, the so-called "free energy", has been decreased.
Generally, doing purposeful things involves doing work, and the ability to do work requires
having free energy at one's disposal. So getting hold of free energy is a necessary
requirement to achieve one's goals whatever they are, and it is even the archetypical
goal itself, as can be seen with some species of animals that forage for food, which 
contains free energy in the form of chemical energy, during a large share of 
their time.

The impingement of directed sunlight on the earth is an abundant source of free energy, which has
enabled that life could evolve on our planet. But since most forms of agents cannot make immediate
use of solar energy, the first law still entails the scarcity, or at least limitedness of practically 
usable energy in most situations, and the second law prohibits its reusal after it has
once been used to do work and then dissipated into its environment. If one subscribes to the idea that 
what happens in the observable world is governed by the laws of physics, then the discussion so
far helps to undertand the two constraints that we encounter in most situations: the scarcity
of resources and the necessity of interventions when seeking to achieve one's goals.

<p class=PGStandard style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB>
The first three laws of thermodynamics can be written formally as such:<br><br>
<u>Zeroth law:</u> If system A is in thermal equilibrium with system B, and system B 
is in thermal equilibrium with system C, then C is also in thermal equilibrium with
system A. The property equal across all three systems is called <i>temperature</i> (denoted by T).<br><br>
<u>First law:</u> The internal energy (denoted by U) of an isolated system stays constant.<br><br>
<u>Second law:</u> Changes within an isolated system increase its entropy (denoted by S).<br><br>
</span></p>
<p class=PGStandard style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB>
"Changes within an isolated system", if deemed phyically possible and not just hypothetical, are
<i>spontaneous, or entropic, processes</i>. They imply in accordance with the second law that:
\begin{equation}
\Delta S_{total} > 0
\end{equation}
Systems into which an agent intervenes or from which it draws its power are mostly 
open rather than isolated. So,
while we are aware that the total entropy change that is implied by any physical process will be positive, it
is more instructive to look at a physical quality that is more specific to the system itself, excluding
the concomitant change in the surroundings:
\begin{equation}
\Delta F = \Delta U - T \Delta S
\end{equation}
</span></p>
<p class=PGStandard style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB>
The quality F (free energy, or Helmholtz energy) immediately builds upon the previously introduced qualities.
A system that can communicate with its surroundings via exchange of 
heat will try to minimize its free energy. If it absorbs heat from the surroundings, the increase
in U will be outweighed by the concomitant increase in TS, with a net decrease of F during the process.
On the other hand, a spontaneous process might occur in the system that either merely increases its
entropy (and thereby reduces its free energy) without effects on the internal energy. Or a spontaneous
process occurs that releases heat to its surroundings, which then also reduces the internal energy.
</span></p>
<p class=PGStandard style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB>
System changes describable by changes in F assume that the system's volume stays constant. A bit more
relevant for biological examples and some examples from engineering are those that involve another
quality, which is called <i>Gibbs energy</i> and whose change is defined by:
\begin{equation}
\Delta G = \Delta F - p \Delta V
\end{equation}
</span></p>
<p class=PGStandard style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB>
By the corrective term \( p \Delta V \) we take into account the expansion work that the system might
exercise or receive from its surroundings. Thus if a system expands during a spontaenous change, the above
formula predicts that \( \Delta G \) will be negative.
</span></p>
<p class=PGStandard style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB>
In analogy to the second law, which describes spontaneity in an isolated system, the following two laws
can be formulated:<br><br>
At constant volume, a process is spontaneous if it corresponds to a descrease in Helmholtz energy.<br><br>
At constant pressure, a process is spontaneous if it corresponds to a decrease in Gibbs energy<br><br>
</span></p>
<p class=PGStandard style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-GB>
The relevance this has to agency is that spontaneous processes occurring in accordance with one of the two
laws above not only sometimes release heat, but can also enable the extraction of work. As long as F (or G)
is not zero, the system can in principle be used as a source of power for bringing about non-spontaneous processes elsewhere,
i.e. for making purposeful interventions.

<b>Free energy as a goal of actions</b><br>
Disposing of free energy is necessary to be able to change the environment in a specific manner, 
and its consumption in the form of Gibbs energy is
necessary for biological organisms in order to maintain their functionality. Obviously, organisms do not just "have" Gibbs
energy. They can neither create it (due to the first law) nor reuse it indefinitely (due to the second law). So they
have to acquire tokens of it. On earth we also do not simply have an abundant source of Gibbs energy that can be readily
tapped by anyone that comes along. It is dispersed here and there, sometimes new tokens are created (by plants) by
making use of the directed sunlight that impinges on the earth's surface. Scarcity of resources by default creates competition.
In order to get hold of Gibbs energy, other competitors have to be outplayed. In order to outplay them, you have
to have established for yourself a smarter policy of options (by learning), furnished yourself a better functioning organism (by
growing one), or already brought yourself in an advantageous situation to begin with (by occupying a place on the playing
field where you would not have ended up accidentally). All of these advantages for raising the chance of getting hold
of Gibbs energy require having done purposeful interventions beforehand, which requires having consumed Gibbs energy.
The Gibbs energy has been spent in order to create that purpose-machine that is other body and our mind, but in turn
our body's and our mind's purpose is to acquire Gibbs energy. Whatever other characteristic we might want to supplement
the concept of "goal" with, we already know (See <a href="Level1.htm">Level 1</a>) that it is a state that will not
be reached by merely waiting until one drifts there. The interventions required to actually get there presuppose
an apparatus that exerts them, and that apparatus will in turn not be in place by mere accident. Therefore, the goal
of disposing of Gibbs energy (or other forms of free energy if we are not talking about organisms) can rightly
be regarded as the primordial goal on which all other goals depend.
